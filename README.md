# MyRayTracer

January 2021<br />
Letter: I meant to learn more about graphics in order to complete my personal project on Raymarching. This is what I ve learnt so far and I am planning to optimize this simple raytracer by using CUDA API provided by NVIDIA. If I increase the FPS, I will be able to implement a camera.<br />
A functional raytracer exploring the maths behind the pixels with the help of the online version of the book: Raytracing in a Weekend.
<br />
Implemented in OpenGl.

Libraries used:
GLFW
GLEW

Implemented:
<br />
Vector class.<br />
Raycasting.<br />
Primitive shape: sphere.<br />
Shading and surface normals.<br />
Diffuse Material.<br />
Mirrored Light Reflection.<br />
<br />
A Makefile would spare the trouble of installing the different libraries. This is a plan for the recent future.
